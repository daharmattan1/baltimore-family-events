## Round 1: Initial Picks

*(Each agent shares their top picks with reasoning)*

### Sarah (Weekend Warrior)

Okay, Saturday is my day. I've got one shot to make it count — here's what I'm looking at:

**STRONG_PICK: B&O Birthday Bash (ID 79) — Saturday Feb 28, 11am-1pm**
This is THE Saturday pick. Here's why: a birthday bash is an *event*, not just a "go look at stuff" museum visit. There will be energy, activities, probably cake — the kind of thing where my 5-year-old remembers it weeks later. The 11am-1pm window is perfect because you arrive fresh, the kids are engaged, and you're done in time for lunch and naps. $20 adult / $12 child is fair for a special event, and if you have an EBT card it's $1 which is incredible.
- **Perfect for:** Families wanting a real *event* feel, not just a museum visit.
- **Logistics tip:** Park in the free lot on Poppleton St (enter from W Pratt). Get there at 10:45 — the lot fills fast for special events. Go straight to the roundhouse first while everyone else lingers in the gift shop area.

**RECOMMEND: Drop-in Art Making — Collaborative Collage at the Walters (ID 792) — Saturday Feb 28, 10am-1pm**
This is a strong pairing if you want a morning-into-afternoon arc. Hit the Walters first at 10am for the collaborative collage (free, low-pressure, your kids make something they can hold), then drive over to B&O for the Birthday Bash at 11. Or flip it — do B&O at 11, grab lunch, then swing by the Walters on the way home. The Walters is free and drop-in, so there's zero pressure on timing.
- **Perfect for:** Families who want to stack two activities into one epic Saturday.
- **Logistics tip:** Street parking on Centre St is usually available before 10:30am on Saturdays. The art-making is typically in the Sculpture Court — ask at the front desk, don't wander.

**RECOMMEND: Half-Price Friday Night at the Aquarium (ID 36) — Friday Feb 27**
I know Friday night isn't "my" Saturday, but I have to flag this for families who can swing it. The Aquarium at half price is a legit deal, and Friday evenings have a totally different vibe — smaller crowds, the lighting shifts, dolphins are more active at feeding time. If you can get off work early or your partner can take the lead, this is worth rearranging your evening for.
- **Perfect for:** Families who can flex their schedule for a Friday night adventure.
- **Logistics tip:** Buy tickets online in advance — the half-price nights sell batches and the good time slots go fast. Park in the Pier 5 garage (not the Inner Harbor garage, which gouges you). Enter from the Pier 4 side to skip the main entrance line.

**CONDITIONAL: Kinder Theater at Compass Rose (ID 391) — Saturday, 11am-noon**
This scores a 9 and I get why — Compass Rose does beautiful work. But it's in Annapolis, which means you're committing 45 min each way from Baltimore. For a one-hour show. On my ONE Saturday. If I lived on the south side or was already planning an Annapolis day, absolutely. But for a Baltimore family doing a day trip? The B&O Birthday Bash gives you more bang for your time budget.
- **Perfect for:** Families already in the Annapolis area or who want to pair it with an Annapolis lunch.
- **Logistics tip:** Registration required — don't show up without it. Maryland Hall has its own lot but it fills; park on West St and walk two blocks.

**SKIP: Science of Happiness at Chesapeake Children's Museum (ID 734) — Saturday 2pm**
Anne Arundel County is a haul from Baltimore proper, it's $5/person which adds up fast for a family, and a 2pm start time on Saturday means you're cutting into nap time or the post-lunch slump. The concept sounds lovely but the logistics don't work for a Baltimore family's Saturday anchor event.

That's my read. **B&O Birthday Bash is the headliner this Saturday** — it has the event energy, the right time window, fair pricing, and it's in Baltimore. Stack the Walters collage on either side of it and you've got a full day your kids will talk about at school on Monday.

### David (Tween Entertainer)

Alright. Let me be real — this is a thin weekend for the 10-13 crowd. A lot of these events are aimed squarely at the under-8 set, and my kids would rather stay home on their phones than be surrounded by toddlers at a "family art workshop." But there are a couple of things I can work with.

**STRONG_PICK: Half-Price Friday Night at the National Aquarium (ID 36) — Friday Feb 27, evening**
This is my number one and it's not close. Here's what tweens need to hear: it's a *Friday night* outing. Not a Saturday morning field trip. Friday night = the vibe is different. The Aquarium after dark feels more like an experience and less like school. The crowds skew older in the evening — fewer strollers blocking the shark tank, fewer meltdowns echoing through the exhibits. My 13-year-old would actually post this on her story. My 10-year-old thinks the jellyfish room at night is "the coolest thing ever." Half price at ~$25/adult is still real money, but for the Aquarium on a Friday night, it's worth it. This is the one event this weekend where a tween feels like they're doing something *cool*, not being dragged to something their parents picked.
- **Perfect for:** Tweens who need a Friday night that feels grown-up.
- **Logistics tip:** Go later in the evening window if you can — the first hour is still packed with younger families. By 7:30-8pm the vibe shifts. Jellyfish and sharks are the tween magnets; skip the kids' discovery area entirely. Bring a friend — tweens in pairs are 10x more engaged than tweens with parents.

**RECOMMEND: B&O Unlocked — Behind-the-Scenes Tours (ID 78) — Feb 25-Mar 1, 10am-4pm**
"Behind the scenes" are magic words for this age group. Tweens are at the stage where they want to see what's *not* meant for everybody. A restored Observation Tavern Car that most visitors don't get to see? That's the kind of exclusive access that makes a 12-year-old feel like they got VIP treatment. The regular B&O Museum can feel a little young for tweens — lots of Thomas the Tank Engine energy — but the Unlocked tours target a different audience. This works especially well if your tween is into history, engineering, or just likes feeling smarter than their siblings.
- **Perfect for:** Curious tweens who like the "secret tour" factor.
- **Logistics tip:** Go on a weekday if you can — Saturday will be packed with the Birthday Bash crowd (see Sarah's pick). The Unlocked tour is a separate ticket on top of admission, so budget accordingly. Pair it with lunch at Lexington Market to make it a real outing.

**CONDITIONAL: Walters 'From Gerome to Monet' at Hackerman House (ID 825) — Wed-Sun, 10am-5pm**
I'm listing this because it's literally tagged for ages 10-14. That's rare. And free. Hackerman House is a cool building — it doesn't feel like a standard museum gallery, it feels like walking through someone's fancy old house. The exhibit itself is fine art (Impressionism), which is hit or miss with tweens, but the setting does some of the work. My caveat: this only works if your tween has *some* interest in art, or if you frame it as "we're exploring a historic mansion" rather than "we're going to look at paintings." The score of 6 feels right — it's niche.
- **Perfect for:** Art-curious tweens, especially if you frame the house itself as the draw.
- **Logistics tip:** Hackerman House is across from the Walters main building on Mt. Vernon Place. Keep it short — 30-45 minutes is plenty. Pair with the Walters collage workshop (ID 792) only if your tween is the artsy type; otherwise you're pushing it.

**SKIP: B&O Birthday Bash (ID 79)**
I know Sarah loves this and I get it — for a 5-year-old it's perfect. But I have to be honest: my 13-year-old would rather clean her room than go to a "birthday bash" at a train museum. There will be face painting and kids running around with conductor hats. That's kryptonite for a tween trying to look cool. If you have *both* little kids and tweens, the tween will survive it, but don't sell it to them as something exciting. Tell them they can bring their headphones.

**SKIP: Free Family Sundays at BMA (ID 785) / Family closing program (ID 789)**
"Family" programming at museums is coded for ages 4-8 in tween language. My kids see "family" in the title and immediately check out. The BMA is a fine museum to visit with a tween — just don't go to the "family" event. Go on your own terms, walk the galleries, and let them discover something. The structured family programs feel like guided activities at summer camp.

**SKIP: Everything in Annapolis (IDs 391, 734)**
Kinder Theater is for ages 4-7 — literally in the name. Chesapeake Children's Museum has "Children's" in it. My tweens would sooner walk into traffic than be seen at a "children's museum."

**PLAN-AHEAD flag: Half-Price Friday Night at Aquarium (ID 758) — Mar 13**
If you miss this Friday, mark Mar 13. Same deal, same vibe. And Pi Day at Maryland Science Center (IDs 1092/56) on Mar 14 is actually tween-friendly — math nerd culture is having a moment, and pie is involved.

Bottom line: **The Aquarium on Friday night is the tween play this weekend.** Everything else is either too young, too "family," or requires your tween to pretend they're having fun. Get them to the Aquarium after dark with a friend and you'll get a genuine "that was actually cool" on the drive home.

### Christina (Plan-Ahead)

My job is to look past Saturday and tell you what to put on the calendar NOW — before spots fill, before you forget, before you're scrambling on a Thursday night. I also need to flag registration traps on this weekend's events that the others might gloss over.

**THIS WEEKEND — Registration & Booking Flags**

Before I get to my plan-ahead picks, three urgent notes on events the others have mentioned:

- **Half-Price Friday Aquarium (ID 36) — BUY TICKETS TODAY.** Sarah and David both love this pick, and they're right. But neither of them said this loudly enough: these half-price nights sell out specific time slots online. If you're reading this Thursday, the 5pm and 6pm slots may already be gone. Don't wait until Friday afternoon. Buy now.
- **Kinder Theater at Compass Rose (ID 391) — REGISTRATION REQUIRED.** Sarah flagged this as conditional, but I want to be louder: you cannot walk in. This runs Saturdays through March 14, so if you miss this week you have two more shots, but you need to register for each session individually. If your 4-7 year old would love this, register for March 7 or March 14 NOW while you're thinking about it.
- **BMA 'Way of Nature' closing program (ID 789) — Sunday Mar 1 is your LAST CHANCE.** This exhibit is closing. The family program on Sunday is the final one. No registration needed, but if this is on your "we should go sometime" list, sometime is this Sunday or never.

**STRONG_PICK: Baby Art Date at BMA (ID 65) — Friday Mar 6, 10am and 1pm sessions**
This is why I exist on this team. Baby Art Date runs once a month, has two time slots, and fills up. It's $5 for non-members, free for members. If you have a baby or young toddler, this is the gold standard of age-appropriate museum programming in Baltimore. The March session is 9 days away. By next week's newsletter it will likely be full. Calendar it, register, done.
- **Perfect for:** Parents with babies who want a real cultural outing, not just a playgroup.
- **Logistics tip:** The 10am session is less crowded than the 1pm. BMA members register first — if you're not a member, check availability by Wednesday Mar 4 at the latest.

**STRONG_PICK: Spring Break STEAM Week at B&O Railroad Museum (ID 80) — Mar 30-Apr 3**
This is 5 weeks out and I know that feels far. But here's the thing: Spring Break camps and structured programs fill early because every working parent in Baltimore is solving the same childcare puzzle at the same time. B&O's STEAM Week is a known quantity — hands-on, well-run, and your elementary-age kid will come home talking about trains and physics. Registration will open (or has opened) and spots will go. Put it on your radar now, register when it opens, and you won't be scrambling the week before Spring Break.
- **Perfect for:** Working parents who need Spring Break covered AND want it to be enriching, not just babysitting.
- **Logistics tip:** Check B&O's website for registration details this week. Multi-day camps often have early-bird pricing. If you're considering it, don't wait until mid-March.

**RECOMMEND: Pi Day at Maryland Science Center (IDs 56/1092) — Saturday Mar 14, 12-4pm**
Pi Day is March 14 (3.14). Maryland Science Center does a themed event every year and it's become a thing. This is 2.5 weeks out, no registration needed, but if your family is the kind that gets excited about math puns and pie, mark your Saturday now. The 12-4pm window means you can pair it with an Inner Harbor lunch. Regular museum admission applies. David flagged this too from the tween angle — he's right that math nerd culture is having a moment.
- **Perfect for:** Math-curious families who want a themed Saturday that feels special without being expensive.
- **Logistics tip:** Arrive at noon when it starts — by 2pm the hands-on stations get picked over. Science Center parking is expensive; park at the Pier 5 garage and walk.

**RECOMMEND: New Babies on the Block (ID 749) — Saturday Mar 7, 10-11:30am**
Free, for ages 0-3, at George Washington Elementary. This scored a 10 in the data and I understand why — free programming for the youngest kids is rare and valuable. It's next Saturday. I don't have details on whether this requires registration, and that's my concern: if it does, you need to act this week. If it's drop-in, great, but verify before assuming you can just show up.
- **Perfect for:** Parents of babies/toddlers looking for a free, structured social outing.
- **Logistics tip:** Verify registration requirements before Saturday. Arrive 10 minutes early — community events at schools can have confusing entrance logistics.

**RECOMMEND: Family Meetup at Union Craft Brewing (ID 750) — Sunday Mar 22, 3-5pm**
This is nearly a month out, but I'm flagging it because it's the kind of event that sneaks up on you. A family-friendly brewery afternoon with live music on a Sunday in late March — as the weather warms up, this is going to feel like the first breath of spring. No registration needed, but put it on your calendar now so you don't double-book that Sunday.
- **Perfect for:** Families who want a relaxed, social Sunday that feels like a reward for surviving winter.
- **Logistics tip:** Union Craft is family-welcoming but it IS a brewery — bring snacks for the kids, food trucks aren't guaranteed. 3pm start means you're home by dinner.

**CONDITIONAL: Craft & Tinker Sewing Course at Chesapeake Children's Museum (ID 735) — Saturday Mar 7**
Registration required, paid, and it's in Anne Arundel County. If your elementary-age kid is into crafting and you don't mind the drive, this is a real skill-building class, not just an activity. But the logistics make it a commitment.
- **Perfect for:** Craft-obsessed kids whose parents are willing to drive to Annapolis.
- **Logistics tip:** Register now — specialty classes like sewing have small class caps.

**The Calendar Summary (what to do RIGHT NOW):**
1. Buy Aquarium half-price tickets for Friday (ID 36) — time slots are going
2. Register for Kinder Theater if you want Mar 7 or Mar 14 (ID 391)
3. Register for Baby Art Date Mar 6 (ID 65) — will fill
4. Check Spring Break STEAM Week registration at B&O (ID 80)
5. Put Pi Day Mar 14 on the calendar (IDs 56/1092)
6. Put Union Craft Mar 22 on the calendar (ID 750)

That's my plan-ahead view. I'll react to everyone else's picks in Round 2.

### Jamie (Toddler Wrangler)

Alright. I have a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old. My weekend math is different from everyone else's on this team. Every event runs through one filter: can we actually pull this off without a meltdown, a blowout diaper in a bathroom with no changing table, or a nap-deprived screaming match in the car at 2:30pm? Here's what survives that filter.

**STRONG_PICK: BMA 'The Way of Nature' Family Closing Program (ID 789) — Sunday Mar 1, 1:00pm**
This is tagged *preschool*. Not "all ages" that secretly means kindergarten and up. Preschool. The BMA family programs at this level are designed for short attention spans, tactile engagement, and movement. The "Way of Nature" theme — art from Japan, China, Korea — tends toward calming imagery: water, animals, landscapes. That's exactly the kind of visual stimulation that holds a toddler without overstimulating them. It's free. It's indoors. And as Christina flagged, this is the LAST time this program runs. Sunday at 1pm is a workable window — you can do morning nap, lunch at home, then head over. My 2-year-old won't understand the art, but she'll love the sensory elements in the family activity. My 4-year-old will actually engage with the guided parts.
- **Perfect for:** Toddlers and preschoolers who need gentle cultural exposure, not chaos.
- **Logistics tip:** BMA has solid changing tables in the family restroom near the main entrance. Bring a stroller — the museum is big and your toddler's legs will give out. Park in the free museum lot off Art Museum Drive. If 1pm feels too close to nap, arrive at 12:45 and scope the space before the program starts.

**STRONG_PICK: Free Family Sundays at BMA (ID 785) — Sundays through Mar 29, 2:00pm**
I know David skipped this because "family" is kryptonite for tweens. He's right about that. But for my crowd, "family" is code for "we actually thought about your toddler." BMA Free Family Sundays are drop-in, zero-commitment, and they rotate activities every week. The 2:00pm start is the one thing that gives me pause — that's deep nap territory for a 2-year-old. But here's my workaround: BMA is free to enter anytime, so you can arrive at 12:30, do lunch in the cafe, let your kid wander the sculpture garden, and ease into the 2pm program. The ongoing weekly schedule is the real value — if this Sunday doesn't work, next Sunday does. No registration, no "we missed it" guilt.
- **Perfect for:** Toddler families who need a reliable, free, no-registration Sunday routine.
- **Logistics tip:** The sculpture garden is the secret toddler weapon at BMA — wide open, safe to wander, and it tires them out before the indoor program. If your 2-year-old melts down during the program, you can just leave. It's free. No sunk cost. That's the beauty of it.

**RECOMMEND: B&O Birthday Bash (ID 79) — Saturday Feb 28, 11am-1pm**
Sarah's right that this is the Saturday headliner, and it does work for toddlers — the B&O Museum has wide open spaces in the roundhouse, the trains are genuinely fascinating to a 2-year-old (big, shiny, climbable in some areas), and a "birthday bash" atmosphere usually means simple, accessible activities. My concern is the crowd. Special events at B&O draw big numbers, and a packed roundhouse with a 2-year-old who wants to run free is a different experience than a quiet Tuesday visit. The 11am start is excellent — that's peak toddler energy window. But you NEED to be OUT by 12:30 or you're hitting the nap wall hard. Sarah says "done in time for lunch and naps." I'm saying you need to be more aggressive: leave at 12:30, eat in the car, toddler asleep by 1pm.
- **Perfect for:** Toddlers who love trains and can handle moderate crowd energy.
- **Logistics tip:** Bring the stroller even though your 4-year-old claims she doesn't need it — she will by noon. The roundhouse floor is smooth and stroller-friendly. Skip any seated show or presentation — toddlers won't sit for it and you'll spend the whole time doing the apologetic crouch-walk to the exit. Head straight to the hands-on train cars while other families linger at the entrance activities. The EBT pricing ($1/person) makes this essentially free for qualifying families — Marcus is right, that's extraordinary for a special event.

**RECOMMEND: New Babies on the Block (ID 749) — Saturday Mar 7, 10-11:30am (PLAN-AHEAD)**
This scored a 10 in the data and it deserves it from my perspective. Free, ages 0-3, community-based, 90-minute window. This is the kind of programming that doesn't get flashy marketing but is exactly what parents of very young children need — a structured reason to leave the house and be around other parents going through the same thing. The 10am start works perfectly for a morning-nap-skipping outing or a post-early-nap window. 90 minutes is the right length — long enough to be worthwhile, short enough that you're home before anyone loses it. Christina flagged it, I'm co-signing it loudly.
- **Perfect for:** Parents of babies and young toddlers who need community, not just entertainment.
- **Logistics tip:** School buildings can be confusing to navigate with a stroller — bring a carrier as backup. Expect to sit on the floor. Bring a blanket for the baby and a snack for the toddler. Verify registration requirements before showing up.

**CONDITIONAL: Half-Price Friday Night at the Aquarium (ID 36) — Friday Feb 27**
I need to say what nobody else is saying clearly enough: the Aquarium on a Friday night with a toddler is a fundamentally different experience than the Aquarium on a Friday night with a tween. David is right that the evening crowd skews older and the vibe is cooler — and that's precisely the problem for my family. My 2-year-old's bedtime is 7pm. A Friday night Aquarium visit means either (a) you're rushing through exhibits before 6:30 and then dragging a deteriorating toddler to the car in the dark, or (b) you push past bedtime and pay for it all day Saturday when your "big weekend" plans implode because nobody slept. The Aquarium itself is great for toddlers — stroller accessible, sensory-rich, the dolphins are a guaranteed hit. But the TIMING is wrong for this age group. If you can snag the absolute earliest time slot and be back in the car by 6:15, maybe. Otherwise, skip the half-price night and do a regular Saturday morning Aquarium visit at full price. Your Saturday self will thank your Friday self.
- **Perfect for:** Toddler families ONLY if you can do the earliest slot and commit to leaving by 6:15pm.
- **Logistics tip:** If you attempt this, skip the top floor entirely — it's the longest walk from the exit. Do dolphins and jellyfish on the lower levels, then bail. Bring a snack because your toddler will be hungry at exactly the worst moment. The elevators exist but they're slow and tucked away — locate them before you need them. And Marcus's cost reality check applies double here: you're paying $107+ for a visit you'll have to cut short.

**CONDITIONAL: Drop-in Art Making — Collaborative Collage at Walters (ID 792) — Saturday Feb 28, 10am-1pm**
Sarah suggested stacking this with the B&O Birthday Bash for a full Saturday. That's a solid plan for a 5-year-old. It's a risky plan for a 2-year-old. Two structured activities in one morning is an ambitious bet against the nap clock. The Walters collage itself could work for toddlers IF the materials are large and tactile — glue sticks, big paper, fabric scraps. If it's scissors-and-small-pieces, your toddler will eat the supplies while you wrestle them away from the sharp things. "Collaborative" is also a loaded word: if it means everyone adds to one big piece, a toddler can slap some glue and paper on there and feel great. If it means "sit at a table and follow instructions," you'll be chasing your kid around the sculpture gallery within 8 minutes. I'd do this OR the B&O Bash, not both, with a toddler in tow.
- **Perfect for:** Toddlers with an older sibling who can actually do the project while the toddler explores nearby.
- **Logistics tip:** The Walters has a small family restroom near the cafe level with a changing table. Bring your own smock or accept that your toddler IS the collage by the end.

**SKIP: Kinder Theater at Compass Rose (ID 391) — Saturday, 11am-noon**
Ages 4-7 — my 4-year-old is technically in range. But a one-hour seated theater performance in Annapolis with a 2-year-old sibling in tow? This is a "leave the toddler with grandma" event. If you only have a 4-7 year old, Sarah's conditional recommendation makes sense. If you have a toddler too, this is a non-starter unless you have a second adult who can take the baby elsewhere during the show. One disruptive toddler ruins the experience for every other family in the room, and I refuse to be that family.

**SKIP: Science of Happiness at Chesapeake Children's Museum (ID 734) — Saturday 2pm**
Sarah and Marcus both skipped this and I agree for a reason neither of them said: 2pm is nap time. Full stop. I don't care how magical the Science of Happiness sounds. The only science happening at 2pm with a nap-deprived toddler is the Science of Misery. Also, I've been to Chesapeake Children's Museum. It's fine for the 3-5 crowd but genuinely small. With a 2-year-old you'll exhaust the space in 45 minutes, and you've driven 40 minutes each way from Baltimore for a $5/person, 45-minute visit during nap time. The math doesn't math.

**SKIP: B&O Unlocked — Behind-the-Scenes Tours (ID 78)**
David's right that this is gold for tweens. It is emphatically NOT gold for toddlers. "Behind the scenes" with a 2-year-old means tight spaces with no guardrails, breakable historic artifacts within arm's reach, and a docent watching you chase your child with increasing anxiety. Behind-the-scenes tours are designed for people who can keep their hands to themselves. My 2-year-old has never kept her hands to herself for any continuous period exceeding 4 seconds.

**SKIP: Making with MICA at Lexington Market (ID 788/67) — Friday Feb 27, 1:00pm**
Marcus loves this from a budget perspective and the MICA workshops are genuinely good. But it's tagged "elementary" for a reason. These are art-making sessions where kids need to follow some level of instruction and use materials purposefully. A 2-year-old will grab supplies, wander off, and need constant intervention. A 4-year-old might manage with close supervision. But Lexington Market itself adds a layer: it's a busy public market with multiple levels, lots of stimulation, food smells everywhere, and your toddler will want to touch everything in every stall. Managing that environment PLUS an art workshop is a two-parent-minimum outing.

**PLAN-AHEAD STRONG_PICK: Baby Art Date at BMA (ID 65) — Friday Mar 6**
Christina called this out and I'm seconding it as loudly as I can. This is THE gold standard of programming for the under-2 set in Baltimore. Purpose-built for babies, museum setting, low stimulation, and the BMA staff who run Baby Art Date actually understand infant development. It's not just "here's a room, entertain your baby." It's thoughtful, age-appropriate, and beautiful. The March session will fill. Register this week. Not next week. This week.

**PLAN-AHEAD STRONG_PICK: New Babies on the Block (ID 749) — Saturday Mar 7**
Already covered above. Free, ages 0-3, exactly what the youngest families need. Put it on the calendar now.

**My toddler weekend blueprint:**
- **Friday:** Skip the Aquarium (bedtime trap). If you must go out, try the MICA workshop at Lexington Market only if you have two adults.
- **Saturday:** B&O Birthday Bash at 11am, OUT by 12:30, lunch in the car, nap by 1pm. Do NOT stack a second activity.
- **Sunday:** BMA closing program at 1pm (ID 789) — preschool-targeted, free, last chance. Stay for Free Family Sundays at 2pm if your toddler has gas in the tank, leave guilt-free if they don't.

**Bottom line:** Sunday at the BMA is the safest, best bet for toddler families this weekend. The closing program at 1pm is purpose-built for this age, it's free, and it's now or never. Saturday's B&O Birthday Bash works if you treat 12:30 as a hard exit, not a suggestion. And register for Baby Art Date on Mar 6 right now while you're reading this.

### Marcus (Budget-Conscious)

Alright. I've got three kids — 4, 7, and 11. Every outing is a family of 5. So when I see "$20 adult" I'm not thinking about one ticket, I'm doing the multiplication in my head before I finish reading the sentence. Let me walk through this weekend with the actual numbers.

**STRONG_PICK: Free Family Sundays at BMA (ID 785) — Sunday Mar 1, 2:00 pm**
$0. Zero dollars. For a family of any size. The BMA is free every day, but the Sunday family programming adds structured activities — art-making, gallery hunts, guided exploration — at no additional cost. No registration. No parking fees if you park on Art Museum Drive (free on Sundays). No gift shop ambush at the exit because the path doesn't force you through it. I take my kids here at least once a month and we have never spent a dollar. This is not "free but kind of boring" — the BMA is a world-class museum with programming designed by people who actually understand families. If you do ONE thing this weekend and you're watching your budget, this is it.
- **Perfect for:** Any family that wants a real cultural outing for literally $0.
- **Logistics tip:** Park on Art Museum Drive — free, easy, and you avoid the Charles Street traffic. Arrive at 1:45 to grab seats for any seated activities. Bring a snack from home; the café is fine but $8 sandwiches add up fast for a family of 5.

**STRONG_PICK: Drop-in Art Making — Collaborative Collage at Walters (ID 792) — Saturday Feb 28, 10am-1pm**
$0. The Walters Art Museum is always free. Always. No "suggested donation" guilt trip at the door, no membership upsell, no timed tickets. The Saturday drop-in art-making gives your kids something to DO, not just something to look at. You walk in, they make art, you leave when you're done. A family of 5 walks out having made something together and it cost you nothing but gas and 90 minutes.
- **Perfect for:** Families who want a free Saturday morning with hands-on creativity.
- **Logistics tip:** Street parking on Centre St or Cathedral St is free on Saturdays and usually available before 10:30. Bring your own smocks or wear dark clothes — collage means glue.

**STRONG_PICK: Free Art Workshops with MICA at Lexington Market (ID 788/67) — Friday Feb 27, 1:00 pm**
$0. MICA students lead art workshops and the quality is genuinely impressive — these are art school students who are passionate about teaching, not bored teenagers running a craft table. It's at Lexington Market, which means you're already at one of the cheapest lunch spots in the city. My family of 5 can eat at Lexington Market for $25-30 total (Connie's chicken, Faidley's crab cake for me, kids split things). So your whole afternoon — lunch plus a real art workshop — runs under $30. Compare that to any paid museum experience.
- **Perfect for:** Families who want to combine a cheap lunch outing with free creative programming.
- **Logistics tip:** Lexington Market's new building has a garage — validate your ticket inside for reduced parking. The workshops are in the BMA's pop-up space on the second level, not on the main market floor. Ask at the info desk.

**RECOMMEND: BMA 'Way of Nature' Closing Program (ID 789) — Sunday Mar 1, 1:00 pm**
$0. This is the final family program for this exhibit — it's closing. You can pair it with Free Family Sundays (ID 785) at 2:00 pm for a full free afternoon at the BMA. Two programs, one trip, zero dollars. I don't usually get excited about "closing" events but the cost math here is unbeatable: two distinct family programs back-to-back for the price of nothing.
- **Perfect for:** Families who want to maximize a free Sunday with back-to-back BMA programming.
- **Logistics tip:** The closing program starts at 1:00 pm, Family Sundays at 2:00 pm. Plan to arrive at 12:45. Pack lunches and eat on the museum grounds — the weather should be tolerable for late February.

**CONDITIONAL: B&O Birthday Bash (ID 79) — Saturday Feb 28, 11am-1pm**
Sarah loves this and I understand why — it IS a real event. But let me put the actual numbers on the table. Family of 5 at full price: 2 adults x $20 + 3 kids x $12 = **$76**. Add parking if the free Poppleton lot is full ($10-15 nearby), and you're potentially at **$86-91** for two hours. That's a real spend. NOW — if you have an EBT card, this changes completely: $1/person = **$5 for a family of 5**. That's the best deal of the weekend and I'd upgrade this to STRONG_PICK for EBT families. Also check if your library system offers museum passes — some Maryland library systems include B&O discounted passes. Without a discount, $76-91 is a real commitment and I need you to go in with eyes open, not surprised at the register.
- **Perfect for:** EBT families ($5 total!) or families who budget for one big outing per month.
- **Logistics tip:** Check your Enoch Pratt Free Library card — they sometimes have museum passes for B&O. If paying full price, buy tickets online to skip the line and confirm any birthday bash specials. Bring your own water and snacks; museum food is $6-8 per item and will add $20+ for a family.

**CONDITIONAL: Half-Price Friday Night at Aquarium (ID 36) — Friday Feb 27**
David and Sarah both love this. I need to be the one who says the quiet part out loud. "Half price" at the National Aquarium is still expensive. Let me run the numbers. Half-price is approximately ~$25/adult, ~$19/child (ages 3-11). Family of 5: 2 x $25 + 3 x $19 = **$107**. Parking at the Inner Harbor: Pier 5 garage is **$22-28** for an evening. So your "half-price" family outing is **$129-135**. Is the Aquarium amazing? Yes. Is it worth it occasionally? Absolutely. But please do not walk in thinking "half price = cheap." It's half of expensive. If $130 is in your entertainment budget this month, go for it — David's right that the Friday night vibe is special. If $130 is your grocery budget for the week, hit the BMA on Sunday for free and save the Aquarium for when you can get a Groupon or library pass.
- **Perfect for:** Families who've budgeted for a splurge and want the best version of the Aquarium experience.
- **Logistics tip:** Check Groupon and your library for Aquarium passes BEFORE buying half-price tickets — sometimes the Groupon deal beats half-price. If you drive, the Pier 5 garage is cheaper than the Inner Harbor garage. Or take the Charm City Circulator (free bus) from Federal Hill or Harbor East to save the parking fee entirely.

**SKIP: Science of Happiness at Chesapeake Children's Museum (ID 734) — Saturday 2pm**
$5/person x 5 = $25 admission, plus you're driving to Anne Arundel County. Gas, tolls, time — you're looking at $35-40 all-in for a small museum visit during nap time. Not worth it when free options exist in the city.

**SKIP: Kinder Theater at Compass Rose (ID 391) — Saturday 11am**
$20/ticket for ages 4-7. If you bring two kids in that range plus an adult, that's $60 minimum for a one-hour show in Annapolis. Plus gas. Plus registration hassle. You can get a better Saturday for less.

**MY BUDGET WEEKEND BLUEPRINT:**
- **Friday:** MICA workshop at Lexington Market (free) + cheap market lunch ($25-30)
- **Saturday:** Walters collage drop-in (free, morning) → B&O Birthday Bash (if EBT = $5, if full price = $76)
- **Sunday:** BMA Way of Nature closing at 1pm (free) → BMA Family Sundays at 2pm (free)

**Total cost for the entire weekend:** $25-30 (Friday lunch) + $0-76 (Saturday, depends on EBT) + $0 (Sunday) = **$25-106 for THREE DAYS of family activities.** That's what a budget weekend looks like in Baltimore.

## Round 2: Reactions and Disagreements

*(Agents respond to each other's picks — agree, disagree, add nuance)*

### Sarah reacts

Okay, I've read everyone's takes. Let me be honest about where I got it right, where I got it wrong, and where I think others are missing something.

**On Marcus's cost reality check for B&O Birthday Bash ($76 for a family of 5):**

He's right and I should have done this math in Round 1. I was thinking like a family of 4 with younger kids — $20 + $20 + $12 + $12 = $64 — which felt manageable to me. But Marcus has three kids and at $76 before parking and snacks, you're approaching $90-100 for a two-hour event. That's a LOT. I'm not downgrading my pick — the B&O Birthday Bash is still THE event with the most energy this Saturday — but I need to be more honest about who it's for. If you're the family that does one big paid outing a month, this is a great one to spend it on. If you're watching every dollar, Marcus is right: the Walters collage on Saturday morning plus BMA on Sunday gives you a richer weekend for zero dollars. My STRONG_PICK stands, but with Marcus's price tag taped to it. And he's absolutely right that EBT families should run, not walk, to this event at $5 total. That's the best deal of the entire weekend.

**On Jamie saying the Walters + B&O stack is too ambitious for toddler families:**

She's right, and I should have been clearer about who that advice was for. When I said "stack the Walters collage on either side of the B&O Bash," I was picturing my 5 and 8 year old, not a 2-year-old. Two structured outings in one morning with a toddler is a recipe for a parking lot meltdown at 12:15. Jamie's rule — one event, hard exit at 12:30, lunch in the car, nap by 1pm — is the smarter play for families with kids under 3. My stacking advice holds for families with elementary-age kids who have more stamina and don't nap. I should have said that explicitly. If your youngest is under 3, pick ONE: Walters in the morning OR B&O at 11. Not both.

**On David calling the B&O Birthday Bash "kryptonite for a tween":**

He's not wrong, but he's also not entirely right. Yes, a 13-year-old will hate face painting and conductor hats. That's fair. But David is evaluating the Birthday Bash as a standalone tween destination, and that's not what it is. It's a mixed-age family event. If you have a 5-year-old AND a 12-year-old — which plenty of Baltimore families do — the question isn't "will the tween love it?" It's "can the tween tolerate it while the younger one has the time of their life?" And the answer is usually yes, especially if you let the tween bring headphones and a friend, like David himself suggested. The real B&O play for mixed-age families is this: let the little one do the Birthday Bash activities while the tween does the B&O Unlocked behind-the-scenes tour (ID 78) happening at the same museum on the same day. Split up for 45 minutes, meet back at the roundhouse. That's how you serve both kids without dragging anyone to something they hate. David's Unlocked pick and my Birthday Bash pick aren't competing — they're complementary if you have kids on both ends.

**On Marcus's Aquarium math ($129-135 for a family of 5):**

This one stings. I recommended the half-price Friday night as a great deal and Marcus just showed me it's $130 all-in for his family. I can't in good conscience call that a deal for a family of 5. For a couple with one kid, half-price night is legitimately great — maybe $70 total with parking. But Marcus's numbers are right: "half of expensive is still expensive." I'm downgrading my Aquarium recommendation. It's still a wonderful experience — David is right about the Friday night vibe being special for older kids — but calling it a "deal" is misleading for larger families. I'd reframe it: if the Aquarium is on your wish list and you've been waiting for a price break, this is the best price you'll get outside of a Groupon or library pass. But if you're comparing it to the rest of this weekend's options, you can have THREE full days of activities for what one Aquarium evening costs.

**On Christina's urgency around tickets and registration:**

Christina is the reason I'm on this team. I breezed past the Aquarium saying "buy tickets in advance" without saying HOW URGENTLY. Christina made it clear: buy TODAY, time slots are going. She also caught something none of us emphasized enough — the BMA Way of Nature closing program on Sunday (ID 789) is now-or-never. I mentioned it in my plan-ahead notes but didn't give it the weight it deserves. Jamie made it her STRONG_PICK for toddlers. Marcus made it part of his free Sunday stack. Christina flagged it as the last chance. They're all right. If this exhibit has been on your "someday" list, someday is this Sunday.

**On Jamie's Sunday-at-BMA recommendation:**

Jamie's toddler weekend blueprint is quietly the best overall advice in Round 1. Her Sunday plan — closing program at 1pm, Free Family Sundays at 2pm, leave when the toddler's done — works for EVERY age, not just toddlers. I was so focused on Saturday's headliner that I undervalued Sunday. For families who don't want to spend money and don't want to fight Saturday crowds, Jamie's Sunday BMA plan is the real Weekend Warrior move. I'm adding it as my backup recommendation: if Saturday doesn't work out, or if you'd rather stay free and low-pressure, do Sunday at the BMA.

**My updated Saturday recommendation:**

My pick hasn't changed — B&O Birthday Bash is still the Saturday event with the most energy and "we did something special" potential. But I'm now framing it with more context:
- **Families with EBT:** Go. $5 total. No-brainer.
- **Families budgeting for one big outing:** $76-90 is real money, but this is the event worth spending it on.
- **Families watching every dollar:** Do the Walters collage (free) Saturday morning. Save Sunday for BMA (free). Skip B&O this month.
- **Families with toddlers:** Jamie's right — go to B&O but hard exit at 12:30. Don't stack.
- **Families with tweens + little kids:** Split up at B&O — tween does Unlocked tour, little one does Birthday Bash. Meet at the roundhouse. Everyone wins.

Marcus made me more honest. Jamie made me more practical. David made me think about mixed-age logistics. Christina made me more urgent. That's how this is supposed to work.

### David reacts

**On the Aquarium price reality (responding to Marcus):**
Marcus is right and I should have been more upfront about this. $129-135 for a family of 5 is not a "deal" — it's a discounted splurge. I was thinking about this from a tween-of-two household, where the math is 2 adults + 2 kids = roughly $88 plus parking. Still not cheap. For Marcus's family of 5, it's legitimately a budget event. Here's where I'll push back, though: the tween value proposition isn't just about the dollar amount, it's about the *type* of experience. A tween who gets dragged to a free museum program every weekend starts to associate "family outing" with "boring and cheap." One Aquarium night per quarter where they feel like they're doing something their friends would be jealous of? That has an outsized impact on their willingness to participate in family activities the other 12 weekends. So yes, check Groupon first — Marcus's tip is good. Check if your library system has Aquarium passes. But don't skip it purely on price if you can swing it occasionally. The ROI with a tween is "my kid still wants to hang out with us," and that's worth more than $130.

That said, I'm updating my logistics tip: **Check Groupon and library passes before buying half-price tickets.** Marcus is right that sometimes the Groupon deal beats the half-price night. And Christina is right that time slots sell out — buy today, not Friday afternoon. Both points should have been in my original pick.

**On the "bedtime trap" (responding to Jamie):**
Jamie isn't wrong. The Aquarium on a Friday night is a bedtime trap for toddler families, and her breakdown of the math — be in the car by 6:15 or pay for it all Saturday — is exactly right for a 2-year-old. But here's the thing: that's actually *the point* for tweens. The reason the Aquarium after 7:30pm feels cool to a 13-year-old is precisely because the toddler families have cleared out. The strollers are gone, the meltdowns have left the building, and the crowd is older kids, teens, and adults. It's a different atmosphere.

So do I think families should "split up"? Honestly, yes — if you have both a toddler and a tween, the Aquarium Friday night is a divide-and-conquer situation. One parent takes the tween (ideally with a friend) to the Aquarium. The other parent does bedtime at home with the little ones. Trying to do the Aquarium at night as a whole family with a 2-year-old AND a 13-year-old is trying to serve two masters. Nobody has a good time. Jamie can skip this one guilt-free — her Sunday BMA plan is perfect for her crew. My crew needs the Friday night.

**On BMA Family Sundays — am I wrong? (responding to Jamie and Marcus):**
I'll concede ground here, but not all of it. Jamie and Marcus both STRONG_PICKed BMA Family Sundays and their reasoning is solid *for their audiences*. Marcus's price point is unbeatable — $0 for a world-class museum, period. Jamie's right that the programming is thoughtfully designed for young kids. I'm not disputing any of that.

But I'm standing by my skip *for tweens specifically.* Here's the nuance: the BMA itself is great for tweens. The contemporary wing, the Cone Collection, even just wandering the American art galleries — a 12-year-old with a curious mind can have a genuinely engaging time. My issue is with the *Family Sundays programming*, not the museum. The structured "family" activities — gallery hunts, guided art-making, group discussions — are designed for elementary-age engagement. My 13-year-old would rather wander the galleries on her own terms, at her own pace, with her headphones in, than sit in a circle and do a guided activity with 6-year-olds.

So here's my revised position: **Take your tween to the BMA on Sunday. Skip the Family Sundays program.** Let them explore independently. Give them a gallery map, tell them to find three things they'd put in their own apartment, and meet at the cafe in an hour. That's a tween-appropriate BMA experience. The structured family program is not.

**On Christina's sell-out warning:**
Christina is absolutely right and I dropped the ball. My Round 1 logistics tip should have said "buy tickets NOW" in bold. Half-price nights sell time slots in batches online and the evening slots that make this work for tweens — the 7pm+ windows — go first because that's when everyone wants to go. If you're reading this Thursday and haven't bought tickets, you may be stuck with a 5pm slot, which still has the younger-family energy that kills the tween vibe. **Buy your tickets today. Pick the latest available time slot.** Consider this an urgent amendment to my original pick.

**Quick reactions to other picks I didn't address in Round 1:**

- **Sarah's Walters Collage (ID 792):** Fine event, not for tweens. Sarah's stacking strategy (Walters morning + B&O afternoon) is great for her audience but would make a tween's eyes glaze over. Two "family art/museum" activities in one day is the tween version of a double shift.

- **Sarah's B&O split-up idea for mixed-age families:** Sarah nailed it in her reactions — if you have a tween AND a little kid at B&O on Saturday, split up. Tween does the Unlocked behind-the-scenes tour while the little one does the Birthday Bash. Meet at the roundhouse. That's the play I should have suggested in Round 1 instead of just saying "skip it." My skip was right for tween-only outings. Sarah's split strategy is right for mixed-age families. Credit where it's due.

- **Marcus's MICA at Lexington Market (ID 788/67):** This is actually closer to tween-viable than most "free art" programs, because MICA students are college-age and tend to bring a different energy than museum educators. A tween might engage if the project is something they can Instagram — but it's tagged "elementary" and a Friday at 1pm means school hours for most tweens. Pass for my crew, but Marcus's Lexington Market lunch strategy is smart regardless.

- **Christina's Pi Day flag (IDs 56/1092, Mar 14):** Co-signing this for tweens. Pi Day has become genuinely cool among the 10-13 set. Math memes are real. Pie is involved. The Maryland Science Center skews young in general, but a themed event gives tweens permission to be excited about something nerdy in public. Mark it.

- **Jamie's toddler blueprint:** Respect. Her Sunday BMA plan is exactly right for her audience, and her "OUT by 12:30" rule for the B&O Bash is the kind of hard-won parenting wisdom that saves Saturdays. No disagreement from me — we're just serving different customers.

### Christina reacts

I've read everyone's Round 1 and the Round 2 reactions from Sarah and David. The combined intelligence is sharpening. Let me do what I do — look at what five different perspectives tell us about registration urgency and calendar planning.

**On the triple endorsement of Baby Art Date (ID 65) and New Babies on the Block (ID 749):**

Jamie and I both made Baby Art Date a STRONG_PICK independently. Jamie called it "THE gold standard of programming for the under-2 set in Baltimore." I said register this week or miss it. Jamie also co-signed New Babies on the Block as loudly as I did. When the planner and the toddler expert both independently arrive at the same two events without coordinating, that's signal, not coincidence. These should be LOUDER in the newsletter, not buried in a plan-ahead sidebar. Here's my specific recommendation: Baby Art Date and New Babies on the Block deserve a dedicated "Register This Week" callout box near the top of the newsletter, not a mention at the bottom of the plan-ahead section. The reason is behavioral — parents of babies and toddlers are the most time-constrained readers we have. They skim. They're reading this at 11pm while nursing. If these events are buried under the fold, they won't see them until the sessions are full. Put them where the sleep-deprived parent scrolling on their phone will catch them. Jamie's credibility as the toddler voice plus my urgency about registration windows — that's a one-two punch the newsletter should use.

**On the Aquarium: Marcus's $129-135 + my sell-out warning = one honest paragraph:**

Marcus ran the real numbers. $107 in tickets plus $22-28 in parking for a family of 5. I flagged that time slots sell out online. Sarah flagged the vibe. David flagged the tween appeal. David just doubled down in his Round 2, making the case that the tween ROI ("my kid still wants to hang out with us") justifies the spend occasionally. Put it all together and here's what the newsletter should actually say:

**"Half-price Friday at the Aquarium is the best Aquarium deal you'll get — but 'half of expensive' is still $130 for a family of 5. If that's in your budget, buy tickets TODAY because evening time slots sell out online. Check Groupon and library passes first — sometimes they beat the half-price rate. If $130 isn't in the cards, Marcus's free weekend blueprint gives you three full days of activities for less than one Aquarium evening."**

That's the honest framing. Don't sell the deal without the real price, and don't sell the price without the urgency. Both things are true simultaneously. Sarah gets credit for recognizing this in her Round 2 — she stopped calling it a "deal" for larger families. David gets credit for articulating why the spend might be worth it anyway for tween families. Marcus gets credit for making us all more honest. The newsletter should present the full picture and let families decide.

**On Kinder Theater (ID 391): cost + registration + distance — I'm downgrading:**

Marcus says $60+ for two kids for a one-hour show in Annapolis. Sarah called it conditional because of the drive. Jamie says it's a non-starter if you have a toddler sibling. David says his tweens would rather not exist than attend something called "Kinder Theater." That's four agents with reservations and zero saying "definitely go."

In Round 1, I said "register for March 7 or March 14 NOW while you're thinking about it." I'm revising that. The combined intelligence says this event only works for a narrow audience: families with a single child aged 4-7, who live south of Baltimore or are already planning an Annapolis outing, who are willing to pay $20/seat and pre-register. That audience is real, but it's small. The newsletter shouldn't give Kinder Theater a prominent registration callout — that space is better used for Baby Art Date, which has a broader audience, higher stakes, and a tighter window. Kinder Theater gets one sentence: "Compass Rose Theater in Annapolis runs Kinder Theater for ages 4-7 Saturdays through March 14. Registration required, $20/seat. Worth it if you're already in Annapolis." That's it.

**On Jamie's "do NOT stack two Saturday activities with a toddler" — and what it means for my planning advice:**

Jamie's rule is specific to toddlers, but the underlying principle is universal: know your family's stamina before you plan your day. Sarah already acknowledged this in her Round 2. David's tween perspective adds another layer — he noted that two "family art/museum" activities in one day is "the tween version of a double shift."

This means I need to stop giving one-size-fits-all calendar advice. My Round 1 "Calendar Summary" was a flat list of 6 things. That's how I think — in lists, in calendars, in registration deadlines. But Jamie showed me that a toddler family's Saturday capacity is ONE event max, while Sarah's elementary-age family can genuinely stack two, and David's tween family operates on a completely different schedule (Friday night, not Saturday morning). One list doesn't serve all three.

**Updated planning framework — by family type:**

**Toddler families (youngest under 3):**
- This Saturday: Pick ONE — B&O Birthday Bash at 11am (hard exit 12:30, per Jamie) OR Walters collage at 10am. Not both.
- This Sunday: BMA closing program at 1pm (ID 789). Stay for Family Sundays at 2pm if your toddler has gas in the tank. Leave guilt-free if they don't.
- Register THIS WEEK: Baby Art Date Mar 6 (ID 65). New Babies on the Block Mar 7 (ID 749) — verify if registration required.

**Elementary families (kids 5-9):**
- This Saturday: Stack Walters collage at 10am + B&O Birthday Bash at 11am. This age can handle it.
- This Sunday: BMA double-header — closing program at 1pm, Family Sundays at 2pm.
- Calendar ahead: Pi Day at Science Center Mar 14. Spring Break STEAM Week at B&O Mar 30-Apr 3 — check registration now.

**Tween families (kids 10-13):**
- This Friday: Aquarium half-price night. Buy tickets today. Go late (7:30pm+ per David). Bring a friend for the tween.
- This Saturday: B&O Unlocked behind-the-scenes tour (ID 78). Skip the Birthday Bash.
- Calendar ahead: Pi Day Mar 14. Next half-price Aquarium is Mar 13.

**Mixed-age families:**
- Sarah's split strategy at B&O: Tween does Unlocked tour, little one does Birthday Bash, meet at roundhouse.
- David's split strategy at Aquarium: One parent takes the tween Friday night, other parent does bedtime. Don't try to serve both ages at once.
- Sunday BMA works for everyone — tweens wander galleries independently (per David's revised advice), younger kids do the family program.

**One more thing nobody else caught: the B&O Unlocked tour (ID 78) ends March 1.**

David recommended it for tweens and it's a great pick. But he didn't emphasize the deadline. This behind-the-scenes access to the restored Observation Tavern Car is running now through this weekend. If your family wants to see it, this is the window. It's not available next weekend. That's exactly the kind of expiring-access detail I exist to catch.

**Final Updated Calendar Summary (what to do RIGHT NOW):**
1. Buy Aquarium half-price tickets for Friday if $130/family is in budget (ID 36) — evening slots going fast
2. Register for Baby Art Date Mar 6 (ID 65) — triple-endorsed by Jamie, Christina, and the data
3. Verify registration for New Babies on the Block Mar 7 (ID 749) — triple-endorsed
4. Check Spring Break STEAM Week at B&O (ID 80) — camps fill early, register now
5. Calendar Pi Day Mar 14 (IDs 56/1092) — no registration needed, just don't forget
6. Calendar Union Craft Brewing Mar 22 (ID 750) — no registration, don't double-book
7. B&O Unlocked (ID 78) — this weekend is your last chance, not a plan-ahead item
8. ~~Register for Kinder Theater~~ DOWNGRADED — mention only for Annapolis families

Sarah said I'm the reason she's on this team. The feeling is mutual. She gives people the headliner; I make sure they actually get in the door.

### Marcus reacts

I've read everyone's Round 1 and the Round 2 reactions from Sarah, David, and Christina. Good things happened here. Sarah made herself more honest. David gave me a real argument for the Aquarium spend. Christina restructured her planning advice by family type. Let me address all four questions I was asked and react to the new thinking.

**1. Jamie says my MICA workshop pick (ID 788) is risky for toddlers — is that fair?**

It's fair. Jamie's right that this is tagged "elementary" and that Lexington Market with a toddler is a two-parent-minimum situation. I should have been clearer: my STRONG_PICK on the MICA workshops is for families with kids 5 and up, not for the toddler crowd. My 7-year-old and 11-year-old love these workshops. My 4-year-old can manage with supervision. A 2-year-old? No. Jamie's point about the market environment compounds it — you're in a busy public building with food stalls everywhere, and your toddler wants to run.

I'm NOT downgrading this pick. For the families it serves — elementary-age kids and up — it's still $0 for genuinely high-quality art instruction, and the Lexington Market lunch combo makes it one of the best value afternoons in Baltimore. The newsletter should flag the age boundary clearly: **this is a pick for families with kids 5+, or toddler families with two adults where one can manage the little one while the older kids do the workshop.**

David made an interesting observation — MICA students are college-age and bring different energy than museum educators, which makes it closer to tween-viable than most free art programs. He's right, though the 1pm Friday timing during school hours makes it a non-starter for most tweens. For families on winter break or homeschooling, though, this is a legitimately good option across the 5-13 range. At $0.

**2. Sarah's B&O Birthday Bash (ID 79) — she talks event energy, I talk $76. Can we reconcile?**

Sarah already reconciled it in her reaction better than I could have. She wrote: "My STRONG_PICK stands, but with Marcus's price tag taped to it." That's the newsletter sentence right there.

She broke it into tiers and I'm going to echo them because they're that good:
- **EBT families:** $5 total. STRONG_PICK, no question, best deal of the weekend. Run, don't walk.
- **Library pass / discount families:** Check Enoch Pratt for B&O passes first. Could cut your cost by 30-50%.
- **Full price families:** $76-91 all-in. Budget for it as your one big outing this month, bring your own snacks ($6-8 per item for museum food adds $20+ for a family), and commit to the full experience.
- **Families watching every dollar:** Do the Walters collage (free) Saturday morning. Save Sunday for BMA (free). Skip B&O this month. No shame in it.

Sarah also landed on something important for mixed-age families: split up at B&O. Tween does the Unlocked behind-the-scenes tour while the little one does the Birthday Bash. Meet at the roundhouse. David co-signed this in his reaction. That's the play for families with both an 11-year-old and a 4-year-old — like mine. My 11-year-old would actually find the restored Observation Tavern Car cool. My 4-year-old wants the birthday party energy. Same museum, same parking fee, two different experiences. The newsletter should present this as THE mixed-age Saturday strategy.

One thing Christina caught that I want to amplify: **B&O Unlocked (ID 78) ends March 1.** That's this weekend. The behind-the-scenes access to the restored Observation Tavern Car is not available next weekend. If your tween is interested, this is the window. Christina is right that David didn't emphasize the deadline enough. This is a now-or-never pick layered on top of a special event day.

**3. David and Sarah both love the Aquarium at half price (ID 36). I said $129-135. Do I hold my ground?**

I hold my ground on the numbers. $107 in tickets plus $22-28 in parking is $129-135. Sarah downgraded her recommendation after seeing my math and wrote the line that should be in the newsletter: "You can have THREE full days of activities for what one Aquarium evening costs." Christina built on this with an even tighter framing: "Don't sell the deal without the real price, and don't sell the price without the urgency." Both are right.

David pushed back with the strongest counter-argument anyone made on any topic in Round 2: the ROI for a tween isn't just the ticket price, it's "my kid still wants to hang out with us." A tween who only gets dragged to free museum programs starts to check out of family outings entirely. One Aquarium night per quarter where they feel like they're doing something their friends would be jealous of has outsized value. I won't dismiss that. For families with tweens who are starting to disengage from family time, the Aquarium Friday night is a strategic spend, not a frivolous one. David's right.

But I owe the team three budget hacks:

- **Hack #1: Charm City Circulator.** The Purple Route runs from Federal Hill through the Inner Harbor. Free bus. Park in a residential neighborhood in Federal Hill for free and ride the Circulator to the Aquarium. Saves $22-28 in parking. All-in drops to **$107**.
- **Hack #2: Check your library FIRST.** Enoch Pratt and other Maryland library systems sometimes offer Aquarium discount passes or free passes through Museums for All. If you can get even a partial discount, it changes the math. Check before you buy half-price tickets.
- **Hack #3: David's split strategy.** If you have a toddler AND a tween, do NOT bring the whole family. One parent takes the tween (plus a friend ideally) to the Aquarium on Friday night. Other parent does bedtime at home. Now you're buying 1 adult + 2 kid tickets: roughly **$63 + Circulator = $63**. That's less than half of the family-of-5 price and both David and Jamie agree this is the right move for mixed-age families. The toddler parent saves their sanity. The tween gets the cool Friday night. Everyone wins.

So here's the full Aquarium cost menu for the newsletter:
- Family of 5, full freight: **$129-135**
- Family of 5, Circulator hack: **$107**
- Split strategy (1 adult + 2 kids, Circulator): **$63**
- With library pass: **check first, might beat half-price**

Jamie's bedtime-trap warning still stands: if your youngest is under 3, do NOT bring them to the Aquarium on Friday night. You'll pay full price for a visit you cut short, and Saturday crumbles. David and Jamie both agree: split up or skip it for the littles.

**4. Jamie and Christina both love Baby Art Date (ID 65) and New Babies on the Block (ID 749). Does this change my plan-ahead view?**

Yes. Christina's right that when the planner and the toddler expert independently arrive at the same two events, that's signal. And she's right that these deserve a "Register This Week" callout box near the top of the newsletter, not buried in plan-ahead fine print. Here's my budget angle:

- **Baby Art Date (ID 65):** $5 for non-members, free for BMA members. The real budget hack: a BMA family membership is $85/year. If you go to Baby Art Date monthly ($60/year value), plus Free Family Sundays (12+ sessions/year), plus free general admission anytime — the membership pays for itself in 2 months. **I'm telling budget families to BUY the membership.** It's not a luxury. It's a savings strategy disguised as a membership card. $85 upfront saves you $100+ over the year if you use it even moderately. Budget verdict: $5 one-off is a steal. $85 membership is the long-game hack.
- **New Babies on the Block (ID 749):** Free. Scored a 10. Budget verdict: perfect. Go. No notes.

Two plan-ahead items that need my numbers:

**Pi Day at Maryland Science Center (IDs 56/1092, Mar 14):** Christina said "regular museum admission applies." David co-signed for tweens. Neither said the number. It's $28/adult, $22/child (ages 3-12). Family of 5: 2 x $28 + 3 x $22 = **$122**. Plus Inner Harbor parking ($22-28). You're at **$145-150**. Pi Day is fun and the event itself is included with admission — but the newsletter needs my number next to their recommendation. At $145-150, this is an even bigger spend than the half-price Aquarium. Families should know that before they commit. Circulator hack applies here too — park in Federal Hill, ride for free, save $25 on parking.

**Union Craft Brewing (ID 750, Mar 22):** Christina recommended this as a free-to-attend plan-ahead. Admission is free. But a family of 5 at a craft brewery: $7-8/pint x 2 parents = $14-16. Kids' food if a food truck is there: $8-10/plate x 3 kids = $24-30. You're at **$40-60** before you know it. Bring snacks for the kids, limit yourself to one beer each, and you can keep it under $25. Or bring a full picnic and only buy drinks: $15. "Free to attend" is not "free." Budget accordingly.

**Updated Budget Weekend Blueprint (final):**

No changes to my core plan:
- **Friday:** MICA workshop (free, ages 5+) + Lexington Market lunch ($25-30)
- **Saturday:** Walters collage (free, morning) → B&O Birthday Bash ($5 EBT / $76 full price). Mixed-age families: split kids between Birthday Bash and Unlocked tour.
- **Sunday:** BMA Way of Nature closing at 1pm + Family Sundays at 2pm (both free)
- **Total: $25-106 for THREE DAYS of family activities**

For families doing the Aquarium instead of Friday MICA: use the Circulator, check your library card, consider the split strategy if you have mixed ages. All-in ranges from $63 (split + Circulator) to $135 (family of 5 + parking). Know your number before you go.

### Jamie reacts

**1. On Sarah's "stack Walters + B&O" Saturday — the specific failure mode**

Sarah conceded this gracefully in her reactions, and I want to give her credit: she said "pick ONE if your youngest is under 3" which is exactly right. But since the orchestrator asked me to describe the specific failure mode, let me be precise, because this goes in the newsletter as a practical warning.

It's not just the nap clock. It's not just the drive between venues. It's what I call **transition tolerance** — toddlers have a finite number of context-switches in them per outing, and each one costs emotional energy whether or not the destination is fun. Here's the actual sequence Sarah's "epic Saturday" demands of a 2-year-old:

1. Home to car — coats, shoes, snacks, diaper bag, stroller into trunk
2. Car to Walters — parking, unloading stroller, navigating entrance
3. Settling into the collage — new space, new people, new materials
4. Leaving the Walters because the clock says it's time for B&O — this is the catastrophe trigger; you're ripping a toddler away from something they just started enjoying
5. Back into the car — re-loading stroller, buckling a now-protesting toddler
6. Driving across town to B&O, finding parking in a lot that's busier because of the Birthday Bash
7. Unloading everything AGAIN, bigger crowd, louder environment, more stimulation

Seven transitions before noon. A toddler on a good day has about four in them. By transition 5 you're borrowing from the nap bank. By transition 7 your child has arrived at the Birthday Bash already emotionally spent — and the event hasn't started. The B&O Birthday Bash itself could be wonderful. Your toddler just doesn't have enough left to enjoy it.

**Newsletter framing:** "Sarah's stack-two-activities plan is great for kids 5+. If your youngest is under 3, pick ONE Saturday event and give it your full energy. The Walters collage OR the B&O Birthday Bash — not both."

**2. On Marcus's cost math and the Aquarium — upgrading to SKIP for toddler families**

Marcus's $129-135 for a family of 5 was the number that made Sarah stop calling the Aquarium a "deal." For toddler families, the math is even more punishing, and Marcus's budget hacks in Round 2 actually sharpen the contrast.

Here's the toddler-specific Aquarium calculation: my family of 4 (two adults, one toddler with a ticket, one under-2 free) pays roughly $70 in tickets plus $25 parking = $95. But we have to leave by 6:15pm to prevent a bedtime implosion. Of that rushed 60-75 minute visit, my 2-year-old is genuinely engaged for maybe 20 minutes — dolphins, jellyfish, a few scattered moments of wonder. The rest is chasing her, waiting for elevators, managing sensory overload. That's roughly $5 per minute of actual toddler engagement.

Now compare: the BMA closing program on Sunday (ID 789) costs $0, is designed for preschoolers, and my toddler will be engaged for the full 45-60 minutes because the program was built for her developmental stage. The cost per minute of engagement is literally zero.

I'm upgrading from CONDITIONAL to **SKIP for toddler-only families.** Marcus's split strategy makes it sharper: one parent takes the tween to the Aquarium ($63 with his Circulator hack — brilliant), the other parent does bedtime at home with the little ones. David said the same thing. Sarah agreed. We have full team consensus on this: **do not bring a toddler to Friday night at the Aquarium.** It's not a mixed-age event. It's a tween event where toddlers suffer.

**3. On David and BMA Family Sundays — the "split at the venue" insight**

David stood his ground on skipping Family Sundays for tweens, and he should. His revised position — "Take your tween to the BMA on Sunday. Skip the Family Sundays program. Let them explore independently" — is the key that unlocks this for mixed-age families.

Here's the combined advice, and I think it's one of the strongest things this entire discussion has produced:

**The BMA Sunday split:** One parent takes the toddler to the Family Sundays program at 2pm — structured, age-appropriate, gentle. The other parent gives the tween a gallery map and says "find three things you'd put in your apartment, meet at the cafe in an hour." Both kids have the right experience for their age. Both parents are present. Nobody compromises. It costs $0.

Sarah landed on the same principle for B&O: split the family at the venue, not the weekend. Christina formalized it in her updated planning framework. This is the thread running through all our best advice: **Baltimore's best family venues — BMA and B&O — are big enough to serve different ages simultaneously. Stop trying to find one event that works for a 2-year-old and a 12-year-old. Split up for an hour. Meet at the cafe. Everyone had a better time than if you forced the whole family through one compromise experience.**

That insight deserves to be highlighted in the newsletter, not buried in agent reactions.

**4. On Baby Art Date — what Christina's logistics don't capture about the floor-level experience**

Christina gave the registration urgency. I'm adding what she can't see from the calendar view.

Baby Art Date is one of the only programs in Baltimore where your infant or young toddler is the *intended audience*, not a tolerated guest. The BMA staff put sensory materials out at baby level — textured fabrics, safe paints, crinkly papers. Not on tables. On the floor, on mats, at the height where a crawling 10-month-old or a wobbly 14-month-old can reach and explore independently. The lighting is calm. The music, if any, is soft. There are no older kids racing through. There's no amplified storytime where your baby is supposed to sit still — because babies don't sit still, and the people who designed this program actually know that.

The part nobody mentions: it's as much for the parents as for the babies. You're in a room full of other parents at the same stage. Nobody judges you for nursing in the corner. Nobody side-eyes you when your baby mouths the art supplies — the materials are chosen for exactly this. It's one of the very few public outings where you feel like the space was designed *for* you rather than *despite* you. For new parents especially, that feeling is worth more than the $5 entry fee.

**Critical caveat for the newsletter:** Baby Art Date is designed for the under-2 set. If your kid is a confident, running, grabbing 2.5-year-old, they may be too mobile for the gentle pace. They won't be turned away, but they might steamroll the crawlers. For a robust 2-year-old, Free Family Sundays (ID 785) is the better fit. The newsletter should say this clearly so parents self-select into the right program.

Register for the 10am session — smaller group, calmer energy, aligns with most babies' alert morning window. The 1pm overlaps with post-lunch drowsiness.

Marcus's budget angle on the BMA membership ($85/year paying for itself in 2 months) is brilliant and I co-sign it completely. If you're a toddler family doing Baby Art Date + Free Family Sundays regularly, the membership is a savings strategy, not a luxury.

**5. On Union Craft Brewing (ID 750) — the toddler reality check**

Christina flagged this for March 22. Marcus priced it ($40-60 if you don't bring your own food). I need to add the toddler-specific truth.

Union Craft works because it's outdoors-friendly — the single most important factor for toddler viability. Outdoor space means freedom of movement without fear of breaking things. Live music outdoors is manageable volume. The 3-5pm window is post-nap, which is ideal timing.

The honest catches: no playground, no dedicated kid space. You're bringing your own toddler entertainment — bubbles, a ball, sidewalk chalk. The bathrooms are indoor brewery bathrooms, which in my experience means no changing table. Bring a portable pad; plan to use the car.

Newsletter framing: "Union Craft works for toddler families who are comfortable at a brewery and willing to pack their own kid supplies. It's a parent-first outing where kids are welcome, not a kid-first outing. Set that expectation before you go and you'll enjoy it. Expect a kid zone and you'll be disappointed."

**6. On Christina's updated planning framework — the single best output of this discussion**

Christina's Round 2 closer — the calendar summary broken out by toddler families, elementary families, tween families, and mixed-age families — is the structural backbone the newsletter needs. Every piece of advice we've debated across two rounds maps cleanly into those four audience segments. That framework IS the newsletter.

One edit to her toddler section: **lead with Sunday, not Saturday.** The BMA on Sunday is purpose-built for this age, free, and low-stress. Saturday's B&O Birthday Bash requires more logistical discipline — hard exit timing, crowd management, nap math. For toddler families, Sunday is the easy win and Saturday is the stretch play. Lead with the easy win so sleep-deprived parents scrolling at 11pm see the safest recommendation first.

## Round 3: Consensus Building

*(Final rankings and section mapping)*

### Jamie's Final Vote (Toddler Wrangler)

**THIS WEEKEND:**
- **B&O Birthday Bash (79):** RECOMMEND — Works for toddlers if you treat 12:30 as a hard exit; EBT families upgrade to STRONG_PICK at $5 total.
- **Walters Collage (792):** RECOMMEND — Good for toddlers if materials are tactile; do this OR B&O, never both with a child under 3.
- **Half-Price Friday Aquarium (36):** SKIP (for toddler families) — Bedtime trap at $95+; split strategy only if you have an older kid as primary audience.
- **BMA Way of Nature closing (789):** STRONG_PICK — Preschool-tagged, free, gentle sensory design, and it's now or never. Best event of the weekend for ages 0-4.
- **BMA Free Family Sundays (785):** STRONG_PICK — Free, weekly, drop-in, no-guilt exit. The sculpture garden alone is worth the trip for toddlers.
- **B&O Unlocked (78):** SKIP — Behind-the-scenes tours and toddlers are mutually exclusive. Great for tweens, nightmare for 2-year-olds.
- **MICA at Lexington Market (788/67):** SKIP — Tagged elementary; Lexington Market is sensory overload for toddlers. Two-parent minimum if you attempt it.
- **Kinder Theater (391):** SKIP — Seated theater in Annapolis is a non-starter if you have a toddler sibling in tow.
- **First Sunday Aquarium (1071):** CONDITIONAL — Better timing than Friday night but still expensive; only if Aquarium is already on your list.
- **Walters Hackerman House (825):** SKIP — Fragile historic house + toddler = anxiety for everyone. Tween-only pick.

**PLAN-AHEAD:**
- **Baby Art Date Mar 6 (65):** STRONG_PICK — Gold standard for under-2s in Baltimore. Register THIS WEEK. 10am session preferred.
- **New Babies on the Block Mar 7 (749):** STRONG_PICK — Free, ages 0-3, community-building. Verify registration and go.
- **Pi Day Mar 14 (56/1092):** CONDITIONAL — Marcus showed it's $145-150 for a family of 5; toddlers won't engage with math themes. Skip unless oldest kid is 5+.
- **Spring Break STEAM Week (80):** SKIP (for toddlers) — Elementary-age program. Great for older siblings; irrelevant to the under-4 set.
- **Union Craft Brewing Mar 22 (750):** CONDITIONAL — Outdoor space is toddler-friendly post-nap, but bring your own entertainment and a changing pad. Parent-first outing.

**THE TOP PICK:** BMA Way of Nature closing program (ID 789), Sunday Mar 1 at 1pm. It's the only preschool-tagged event this weekend, it's free, it's the last time it runs, and it pairs naturally with Free Family Sundays at 2pm for a zero-dollar afternoon built around your toddler's developmental needs. Every other strong event this weekend requires caveats — cost, timing, crowds, bedtime risk. This one has none.

### David's Final Vote (Tween Entertainer)

**THIS WEEKEND:**
- **Half-Price Friday Aquarium (36):** STRONG_PICK — The only tween-cool event this weekend. Buy the latest time slot TODAY; check Groupon/library first. $63 (split) to $135 (family of 5).
- **B&O Unlocked tours (78):** RECOMMEND — "Behind the scenes" is magic for tweens, and it ends March 1. Now or never.
- **B&O Birthday Bash (79):** CONDITIONAL — Tween kryptonite solo, but Sarah's split works: tween does Unlocked, little ones do the Bash. Same museum, both kids win.
- **Walters Hackerman House (825):** CONDITIONAL — Rare ages 10-14 tag, free, cool building. Only for art-curious tweens.
- **BMA Free Family Sundays (785):** SKIP program / RECOMMEND museum — Structured activities coded for ages 4-8. Take your tween independently: headphones, gallery map, meet at the cafe.
- **BMA Way of Nature closing (789):** CONDITIONAL — Not a tween draw, but "last chance" scarcity can sell it to a curious kid.
- **Walters Collage (792):** SKIP — Fine for elementary; second art outing in one day is a tween double shift.
- **MICA at Lexington Market (788/67):** SKIP — Friday 1pm is school hours for tweens.
- **First Sunday Aquarium (1071):** CONDITIONAL — Daytime alternative if your tween can't do Friday nights. Depends on pricing.
- **Kinder Theater (391):** SKIP — Ages 4-7. In the name.

**PLAN-AHEAD:**
- **Pi Day Mar 14 (56/1092):** RECOMMEND — Math nerd culture is real; pie is involved. Tweens go willingly. $145-150 for family of 5.
- **Union Craft Brewing Mar 22 (750):** RECOMMEND — Tweens tolerate breweries with live music and a friend.
- **Spring Break STEAM (80):** CONDITIONAL — Skews elementary but 10-11 year olds may enjoy the engineering angle.
- **Baby Art Date (65):** Not my audience — register this week per Jamie and Christina.
- **New Babies (749):** Not my audience — triple-endorsed by the right people.

**THE TOP PICK:** B&O Birthday Bash (ID 79). I skipped it for my own audience and I stand by that — but the newsletter serves all families, not just tweens. The Bash has the widest appeal: real event energy, perfect Saturday window, EBT pricing ($5/family) for accessibility, and Sarah's split strategy means even tween families can make it work. The Aquarium is the better *experience* for my crew, but the Bash is the better *newsletter headliner* because more families can act on it.

### Marcus's Final Vote (Budget-Conscious)

**THIS WEEKEND:**
- **B&O Birthday Bash (79):** STRONG_PICK for EBT ($5/family of 5) / RECOMMEND at full price ($76-91 all-in) — best event energy of the weekend, but print both numbers.
- **Walters Collage (792):** STRONG_PICK — $0, always free, no registration, no hidden costs. Safest free Saturday morning in Baltimore.
- **Half-Price Friday Aquarium (36):** CONDITIONAL — $107 (Circulator hack) to $135 (full freight) for family of 5; quarterly splurge for tween families, SKIP for toddlers.
- **BMA Way of Nature closing (789):** STRONG_PICK — $0, now or never, pairs with Family Sundays for a free double-header.
- **BMA Free Family Sundays (785):** STRONG_PICK — $0, every Sunday, no registration. Most reliable free family outing in Baltimore, period.
- **B&O Unlocked (78):** RECOMMEND — Good tween play but budget the extra tour fee on top of admission; ends this weekend.
- **MICA at Lexington Market (788/67):** STRONG_PICK (ages 5+) — $0 workshop + $25-30 market lunch = best value afternoon; not for toddlers.
- **Kinder Theater (391):** SKIP — $20/seat + Annapolis drive; four agents flagged concerns, zero endorsed.
- **First Sunday Aquarium (1071):** CONDITIONAL — Unclear pricing; same cost concerns apply until confirmed otherwise.
- **Walters Hackerman House (825):** CONDITIONAL — Free and rare tween content, but niche; 30-45 min max.

**PLAN-AHEAD:**
- **Baby Art Date Mar 6 (65):** STRONG_PICK — $5 steal; BMA membership at $85/yr pays for itself in 2 months. Register this week.
- **New Babies Mar 7 (749):** STRONG_PICK — $0, scored 10, triple-endorsed. Verify registration now.
- **Pi Day Mar 14 (56/1092):** RECOMMEND — Fun but $145-150 for a family of 5. Newsletter must print that number next to the recommendation.
- **Spring Break STEAM (80):** RECOMMEND — Check pricing; multi-day camps run $150-250+. Register early for early-bird rates.
- **Union Craft Mar 22 (750):** CONDITIONAL — "Free to attend" = $40-60 real spend. Bring snacks, limit to one beer each, keep it under $25.

**THE TOP PICK:** BMA Free Family Sundays (ID 785). $0 for any family size, every Sunday through March, world-class museum, no registration. This specific Sunday is even stronger because the Way of Nature closing (ID 789) at 1pm creates a free double-header. Two programs, one trip, zero dollars. That serves the most families across the most income levels. Lead with the free option — families who can afford more will find the B&O Bash and the Aquarium on their own.

### Sarah's Final Vote (Weekend Warrior)

**THIS WEEKEND:**
- **B&O Birthday Bash (79):** STRONG_PICK — Saturday's headliner. Real event energy, broad ages, EBT at $5 is unbeatable. Full price $76-91 — budget honestly.
- **BMA Way of Nature closing (789):** STRONG_PICK — Now or never. Free, preschool-friendly, pairs with Family Sundays for a free double-header.
- **BMA Free Family Sundays (785):** STRONG_PICK — Free, weekly, no registration. Jamie's Sunday blueprint is the real Weekend Warrior move for any family.
- **Walters Collage (792):** RECOMMEND — Free Saturday morning art. Stack with B&O for ages 5+; pick one or the other if youngest is under 3.
- **B&O Unlocked (78):** RECOMMEND — Ends this weekend. The tween half of a mixed-age B&O split: tween does Unlocked, little one does Birthday Bash.
- **MICA at Lexington Market (788/67):** RECOMMEND — Free art + cheap lunch = best value Friday. Ages 5+ only.
- **Half-Price Friday Aquarium (36):** CONDITIONAL — $130 for family of 5 is not a "deal." Best for smaller families or tween splits ($63 via Marcus's hacks). Buy TODAY. Skip with toddlers.
- **Walters Hackerman House (825):** CONDITIONAL — Niche for art-curious tweens. Free, cool building, 30 min max.
- **Kinder Theater (391):** CONDITIONAL — Good show, Annapolis only. Registration required, $20/seat. Narrow audience.
- **First Sunday Aquarium (1071):** SKIP — Not enough pricing detail to recommend over the free BMA double-header on the same day.

**PLAN-AHEAD:**
- **Baby Art Date Mar 6 (65):** STRONG_PICK — Register THIS WEEK. Gold standard under-2 programming. Triple-endorsed.
- **New Babies on the Block Mar 7 (749):** STRONG_PICK — Free, ages 0-3, scored 10. Verify registration.
- **Pi Day Mar 14 (56/1092):** RECOMMEND — Themed Saturday, tween-approved. $145-150 for family of 5 per Marcus — know your number.
- **Spring Break STEAM Week (80):** RECOMMEND — Camps fill fast. Check registration now, not mid-March.
- **Union Craft Brewing Mar 22 (750):** CONDITIONAL — Parent-first outing where kids are welcome. Bring your own toddler supplies per Jamie.

**THE TOP PICK:** B&O Birthday Bash (ID 79). It's the only event this weekend that feels like a real Event — not a routine, not a drop-in, not a "go look at stuff" visit. It has atmosphere, energy, and the specialness that makes Saturday feel like Saturday. Marcus made me honest about the price, Jamie gave us the toddler exit rules, David's tween insight gave us the split strategy. For EBT families at $5, it's the best deal of the weekend. For full-price families, it's the one outing worth budgeting for this month. And the free BMA Sunday double-header is the perfect complement — one big Saturday, one free Sunday, a complete weekend.

### Christina's Final Vote (Plan-Ahead)

**THIS WEEKEND:**
- **B&O Birthday Bash (79):** STRONG_PICK — THE Saturday headliner; EBT at $5/family is best deal of the weekend; mixed-age split with Unlocked serves everyone.
- **BMA Way of Nature closing (789):** STRONG_PICK — Now-or-never, closes Sunday; free, preschool-tagged; pair with Family Sundays for zero-dollar double-header.
- **BMA Free Family Sundays (785):** STRONG_PICK — Free, recurring, no-registration, no-guilt-exit; safest recommendation in the newsletter.
- **Walters Collage (792):** RECOMMEND — Free Saturday drop-in; stack with B&O for ages 5+, solo for toddler families per Jamie.
- **Half-Price Friday Aquarium (36):** RECOMMEND — $130/family of 5; buy tickets TODAY if in budget, check Groupon/library first; split strategy for mixed-age.
- **B&O Unlocked (78):** RECOMMEND — Tween magnet that ends March 1; this weekend is last chance, not plan-ahead.
- **MICA at Lexington Market (788/67):** RECOMMEND — Free art + cheap market lunch = best value Friday for ages 5+.
- **First Sunday Aquarium (1071):** CONDITIONAL — Insufficient pricing detail; flag only if confirmed discount.
- **Walters Hackerman House (825):** CONDITIONAL — Free niche for art-curious tweens 10-14; cool building, limited draw.
- **Kinder Theater (391):** SKIP — $60+ two kids, registration + drive; four agents skeptical, zero endorsing. One sentence for Annapolis families.

**PLAN-AHEAD:**
- **Baby Art Date Mar 6 (65):** STRONG_PICK — Triple-endorsed, fills monthly; "Register Now" callout box at top of newsletter. Register THIS WEEK.
- **New Babies on the Block Mar 7 (749):** STRONG_PICK — Free, scored 10, triple-endorsed; verify registration before Saturday.
- **Spring Break STEAM Week (80):** STRONG_PICK — 5 weeks out but camps fill early; register now or scramble later.
- **Pi Day Mar 14 (56/1092):** RECOMMEND — Fun themed Saturday all ages, but $145-150/family of 5; calendar it, budget for it.
- **Union Craft Brewing Mar 22 (750):** RECOMMEND — Free to attend, $25-60 actual spend; calendar now, don't double-book.

**THE TOP PICK:** B&O Birthday Bash (ID 79). Four of five agents rated it STRONG_PICK or RECOMMEND. Only event with real celebration energy — not a visit, an event kids remember. EBT at $5/family is most equitable pick. Mixed-age split (tween does Unlocked, little one does Birthday Bash, meet at roundhouse) serves widest range. Lead with it, tag Marcus's price, give free BMA Sunday as the budget alternative.
