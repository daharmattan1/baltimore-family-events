# This Weekend in Baltimore (For Families)
**February 13-15, 2026**

Hey Baltimore parents! Valentine's Day weekend was stacked. Here's what we picked as the best family events:

---

## Top Pick

**Chocolate Festival** at Grace United Methodist Church (Aberdeen)
Saturday, 10am-2pm | All ages | FREE

The 13th Annual Chocolate Festival has chocolate-dipped strawberries, ice cream sundaes, a cake walk, and a hot cocoa bar. It's free, parking is easy at the church, and there's room for kids to roam.

**Perfect for:** Families who want a free Saturday anchor.

- Arrive by 10:30am to beat the rush. The cake walk gets packed around 11am
- Bring napkins (seriously, bring extra)
- Pairs well with Valen-Tie Dye at Patterson Park Library afterward (1:30pm, also free)
