# Baltimore Family Events: Lunar New Year, Campfires & Railroad History

**Your guide to Baltimore family fun | Feb 18 - Mar 3, 2026**

## Top Pick

**Lunar New Year Celebration: Year of the Horse** at The Walters Art Museum
Saturday Feb 21, 11am-4pm | All ages | FREE

The Walters is going big for Lunar New Year and this one has real main-event energy. Art-making activities, live cultural performances, and a five-hour window so you can arrive when it works for your crew and bail when the 5-year-old hits the wall. The Year of the Horse theming gives kids a narrative thread to follow through the galleries — not just "look at art" but "find the horses." And did we mention free?

**Perfect for:** Families who want a memorable, multi-activity Saturday without spending a dime.

- Free street parking on Charles and Cathedral streets on weekends — two-block walk
- Arrive by 11am before the noon crowd wave. The Walters cafe will tempt you — pack snacks instead
- Coat check at the entrance means you move freely through galleries
- Start with the Drop-in Collage workshop (same building, 10am) for a full morning-to-afternoon outing with one parking spot

## Local Intel
*Insider tips for this weekend's events*

🅿️ **Parking hack:** Skip the $12 Mount Vernon lots near the Walters. Street parking on Charles St and Centre St is free on weekends — two blocks away.
⏰ **Pro tip:** The B&O Museum roundhouse is cold in winter. Dress warmly for Saturday's unveiling — it's not fully heated.
⭐ **Combo move:** Walters Collage Drop-in at 10am + Lunar New Year at 11am = one parking spot, 5+ hours of free programming without leaving the building.
🅿️ **B&O parking:** Free lot on Poppleton St always has space. First train ride at 11am has the shortest wait.

## Quick Weekend Wins
*Just show up — no tickets needed*

1. **Drop-in Art Making: Collaborative Collage** at the Walters - Rip, paste, create together. No skill floor — toddlers can rip paper proudly while the 8-year-old builds something elaborate. Perfect warm-up before Lunar New Year kicks off downstairs.
   Saturday Feb 22, 10am-1pm | FREE
   [Details](https://thewalters.org/events/)

2. **Black History Month: B&O No. 3316 Unveiling** - A restored 1930s observation tavern car gets its public debut. Behind-the-scenes access to a piece of railroad history most visitors will never see. Frame it as "we're going to see a secret room on a train that's been locked away for decades."
   Saturday Feb 21, 11:30am-3pm | Museum admission

3. **Animal Tracking + Ranger Hike + Campfire** at Patuxent Research Refuge - A ranger teaches you to track animals at dusk, then you sit around a real campfire in February. The evening timing makes it feel like a real adventure. Best for ages 6+ (toddlers: skip this one).
   Wednesday Feb 18, 6:30-8pm | FREE | Anne Arundel County

## Budget-Friendly Finds

- **Lunar New Year with Golden Phoenix Lion & Dragon Team** at Crofton Library - Lion and dragon dance performances by a real cultural performance troupe, not a crafts-and-crayons library program.

## For Toddler Families

- **Baby & Toddler Storytime** at Pratt Library branches - 30 minutes of stories, songs, and rhymes designed specifically for birth to age 2. Canton (10am), Roland Park (10:30am), Light Street (10:30am), Govans (10:30am). Hit the Canton session and you're home by 11:30 nap time.
  Wednesday Feb 18 | FREE
  [Details](https://www.prattlibrary.org/events)

- **Toddler Time at B&O Railroad Museum** - Programming designed specifically for ages 1-3. Your train-obsessed toddler will lose their mind in the best way, and the curated programming means age-appropriate attention spans.
  Thursday Feb 19 | Museum admission
  [Details](https://www.borail.org/events/)

- **Mom's Walk + Coffee + Playground** at Patterson Park - Stroller walk around the park, sponsored coffee (free!), and a playground finish. Layer up for February. Bring backup pants — you know why.
  Saturday Feb 21, 9:45-11:45am | FREE
  [Details](https://www.baltimorefamilies.org/events)

## Tween-Approved

- **Defender Elite MMA** for ages 11-14 at JCC Park Heights - Advanced mixed martial arts. The "Defender Elite" name alone passes the cool test, and "advanced" signals it's not baby karate. Combat sports, real skills, a 45-minute drop-off window for you. Check if they offer a trial class.
  Wednesdays 6:15-7pm | $175-225/session series
  [Details](https://www.jcc.org/calendar/)

- **B&O No. 3316 Unveiling** - A restored 1930s tavern car where wealthy travelers drank and socialized, locked away for decades, now being revealed. Behind-the-scenes exclusivity that tweens actually respect. The B&O Museum is large enough for semi-independent exploration while you linger.
  Saturday Feb 21, 11:30am-3pm | Museum admission
  [Details](https://www.borail.org/events/)
