# SEO Audit: bmorefamilies.com

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Auditor:** Claude Code (automated codebase analysis)
**Site:** https://bmorefamilies.com
**Framework:** Next.js 16.1.6 / React 19 / Vercel

---

## Summary

bmorefamilies.com has a strong SEO foundation. Root metadata, OpenGraph tags, sitemap, robots.txt, and a WebApplication JSON-LD schema are all in place. The main gaps are missing page-specific metadata on 3 pages and the previously missing `/classes` + `/places` in the sitemap (fixed in this PRD).

**Overall Score: 7/10** — solid foundation, needs page-level polish.

## Findings

### 1. Meta Tags & Page Titles

**Rating: HIGH IMPACT**

| Page | Title | Description | OG Tags | Status |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|--------|
| `/` (Home) | Bmore Families \| AI-Curated Baltimore Family Events | Yes | Yes + Twitter | PASS |
| `/calendar` | Baltimore Family Events Calendar | Yes | Yes | PASS (via layout) |
| `/subscribe` | Subscribe \| Bmore Families | Inherits root | Inherits root | NEEDS WORK |
| `/about` | About \| How 5 Parent Personas Find Your Weekend | Yes | Yes | PASS |
| `/newsletter` | Newsletter Archive | Yes | Yes | PASS |
| `/classes` | Inherits root | Inherits root | Inherits root | NEEDS WORK |
| `/places` | Inherits root | Inherits root | Inherits root | NEEDS WORK |
| `/privacy` | Privacy Policy | Yes | Inherits root | PASS |

**Recommendation (HIGH):** Add `export const metadata` to `/subscribe/page.tsx`, `/classes/page.tsx`, and `/places/page.tsx` with unique titles and descriptions targeting relevant keywords.

Suggested titles:
- `/subscribe`: "Subscribe to Bmore Families | Free Weekly Baltimore Family Events Newsletter"
- `/classes`: "Baltimore Kids Classes & Sign-Ups | Bmore Families"
- `/places`: "Family-Friendly Places in Baltimore | Bmore Families"

---

### 2. Heading Hierarchy

**Rating: PASS**

All pages follow proper H1 → H2 → H3 hierarchy:
- Homepage: H1 "Your Weekend, Sorted." → H2 sections → H3 subsections
- Calendar: H1 "Find Your Weekend"
- About: H1 "About Bmore Families" → H2 sections → H3 personas
- Subscribe: H1 "Stay in the Loop" (likely)

No duplicate H1 tags detected. Semantic HTML used correctly.

---

### 3. Image Alt Text

**Rating: PASS**

- All decorative images use `alt=""` with `aria-hidden="true"` (correct)
- Next.js `Image` component used throughout (automatic optimization)
- No unoptimized `<img>` tags found
- SVG decorative elements properly marked as decorative

---

### 4. Internal Linking

**Rating: PASS**

Strong cross-linking structure:
- Header nav links to: `/`, `/calendar`, `/classes`, `/places`, `/newsletter`, `/about`, `/subscribe`
- Footer links to: Calendar, Newsletter, About, Subscribe, Privacy
- In-page CTAs cross-link between subscribe, calendar, and about pages
- All links use Next.js `Link` component (SPA navigation + prefetching)

**Recommendation (LOW):** Consider adding contextual internal links within event descriptions or class pages to boost PageRank distribution.

---

### 5. OpenGraph & Twitter Cards

**Rating: PASS**

- Root layout: Full OG metadata with 1200x630 image, locale, siteName
- Twitter: `summary_large_image` card configured
- Page-specific OG overrides on Home, About, Calendar, Newsletter
- OG image properly sized for social sharing

**Recommendation (LOW):** Add page-specific Twitter card metadata for `/subscribe` and `/calendar`.

---

### 6. Canonical URLs

**Rating: PASS (implicit)**

- `metadataBase` set to `https://bmorefamilies.com` in root layout
- Next.js auto-generates canonical URLs from file-based routing
- No duplicate content patterns detected (single URL per page)
- No www vs non-www conflict (Vercel handles redirect)

---

### 7. Structured Data (JSON-LD)

**Rating: IMPROVED (this PRD)**

**Before this PRD:**
- WebApplication schema on root layout (global)
- No Event schema markup

**After this PRD:**
- WebApplication schema (existing)
- Event schema on `/calendar` for up to 20 server-rendered events (new)

**Recommendation (MEDIUM):** Consider adding:
- `LocalBusiness` schema (bmorefamilies is hyper-local to Baltimore)
- `BreadcrumbList` schema for navigation paths
- `FAQPage` schema on About page (it has Q&A-style content)

---

### 8. Sitemap & Robots.txt

**Rating: FIXED (this PRD)**

**Before:** 6 pages in sitemap (missing `/classes`, `/places`)
**After:** 8 pages in sitemap (all public pages included)

robots.txt: Allows all paths, references sitemap. No issues.

---

### 9. Mobile & Viewport

**Rating: PASS**

- Responsive Tailwind CSS throughout (sm:, md:, lg: breakpoints)
- Mobile-first grid layouts
- Touch-friendly button sizes (40px+ tap targets)
- Hamburger menu with proper aria attributes
- Next.js handles viewport meta tag automatically

---

### 10. Performance (Informational — Out of Scope)

**Not audited in depth, but observed:**
- `next/font` with Inter (font optimization)
- GTM loaded with `afterInteractive` strategy (non-blocking)
- All images via Next.js `Image` component (automatic WebP, lazy loading)
- Client components only where needed (`"use client"`)

**Future work:** Run Lighthouse/PageSpeed Insights for Core Web Vitals baseline. Consider `next/dynamic` for modals and drawers.

## Next Steps

1. Add page-specific metadata to 3 pages (P1 — can do in this PRD or a follow-up)
2. Validate Event JSON-LD via Google Rich Results Test after deploy
3. Set up Google Search Console (separate PRD)
4. Run Lighthouse baseline after GTM is confirmed working
