## 1. Target Keywords

### Head Terms (High Volume, High Competition)

| Keyword | Est. Monthly Volume | Difficulty | Current Ranking | Target Page |
|---------|---------------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| baltimore family events | 1,000-2,500 | High | Unranked | `/calendar` |
| things to do with kids in baltimore | 2,000-5,000 | High | Unranked | `/` (home) |
| baltimore events this weekend | 5,000-10,000 | Very High | Unranked | `/calendar` |
| free things to do in baltimore | 3,000-8,000 | Very High | Unranked | `/calendar` (free filter) |

*Volume estimates from Google autocomplete frequency, related searches, and People Also Ask density. Precise volume requires Search Console or paid tools (out of scope).*

### Long-Tail Keywords (Lower Volume, Achievable)

| Keyword | Est. Monthly Volume | Difficulty | Target Page |
|---------|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| free family events baltimore this weekend | 200-500 | Medium | `/calendar` |
| baltimore kids activities near me | 300-800 | Medium | `/places` |
| toddler activities baltimore | 100-300 | Low | `/classes` |
| baltimore summer camps 2026 | 500-1,500 | Medium | `/classes` |
| splash pads baltimore | 200-500 | Low | Blog (future) |
| free museum days baltimore | 100-300 | Low | Blog (future) |

| baby classes baltimore | 50-150 | Low | `/classes` |
| weekend activities for kids baltimore | 200-500 | Medium | `/calendar` |

---

## 3. Internal Linking Improvements

### Current State
- Header/footer nav links to all 8 pages (strong)
- Limited contextual linking within page content

### Recommendations

| From | To | Anchor Text | Priority |
|------|----|-------------|----------|
| Homepage hero | `/calendar` | "Browse this week's events" | Done |
| Homepage | `/classes` | "Find classes and sign-ups" | MEDIUM |
| Homepage | `/places` | "Explore family-friendly places" | MEDIUM |
| Calendar event cards | `/places` | Venue name links | LOW |
| Classes page | `/calendar` | "See upcoming events" | MEDIUM |
| Places page | `/calendar` | "Events at this venue" | MEDIUM |
| Blog guides (future) | `/calendar` with filters | "See all [type] events" | HIGH |
| Newsletter archive | `/subscribe` | "Get this in your inbox" | LOW |

### Hub-and-Spoke Model
- **Hub:** `/calendar` (highest value page)
- **Spokes:** `/classes`, `/places`, guide pages (future)
- Every spoke should link back to the hub with keyword-rich anchor text

---

## 4. Local SEO Recommendations
